- Run `./build.sh` 
- Check the `./build_logs`. 
- Now /work on items from @TODO.md consulting on @PLAN.md
- If needed read the @llms.txt code snapshot
- Review reflect refine revise, and then continue to /work on @PLAN.md and @TODO.md - until every single item and issue has been fixed
- Iterate iterate iterate! 
- Do not stop, do not ask for confirmation. Work! 
- When you're finishing one task or item, say "Wait, but..." and go on to the next - task/item
- Itâ€™s CRUCIAL that we get to a solution that BUILDS everything correctly! 
- Then /report and mark completed items as done in @PLAN.md and @TODO.md
- Then run `./build.sh` and then check the build logs
- Ensure that we build a single-file macOS CLI tool, which works without any external dependencies
- Use all sorts of tools to get additional info and research!
