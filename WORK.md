## 2025-07-12 ‚Äì Critical Build Issues Resolution ‚úÖ

Objective: Fix critical build failures in v2 standalone build system

### üéØ Actions performed in this iteration

1. **Fixed SHA256 Hash Mismatches**
   * Corrected bzip2 SHA256: `ab5a03176ee106d3f0fa90e381da478ddae405918153cca248e682cd0c4a2269`
   * Fixed expat SHA256: `ee14b4c5d8908b1bec37ad937607eab183d4d9806a08adee472c3c3121d27364`
   * Updated harfbuzz SHA256: `109501eaeb8bde3eadb25fab4164e993fbace29c3d775bcaa1c1e58e2f15f847`
   * Corrected gettext SHA256: `fe10c37353213d78a5b83d48af231e005c4da84db5ce88037d88355938259640`

2. **Fixed fetch_and_extract Function**
   * Resolved issue with `--strip-components=1` creating directories named after tar files
   * Fixed extraction logic to properly handle stripped components
   * Corrected CMakeLists.txt not found errors

3. **Fixed Build Configuration Issues**
   * Removed duplicate meson `--default-library` arguments for glib
   * Fixed bzip2 build by removing incorrect `-f Makefile-libbz2_so` usage
   * Eliminated macOS-incompatible `-soname` linker options

4. **Resolved lipo Universal Binary Issues**
   * Fixed architecture-specific build directory handling
   * Prevented attempts to merge same-architecture files

### ‚úÖ Successfully Built Components

* ‚úÖ libjpeg-turbo (universal static)
* ‚úÖ libpng (universal static) 
* ‚úÖ libgif (universal static)
* ‚úÖ bzip2 (universal static)
* ‚úÖ brotli (universal static)
* ‚úÖ expat (universal static)
* ‚úÖ harfbuzz (universal static)
* ‚è≥ gettext (currently building - making good progress)

### üîß Current Status

Build system is now **functional and progressing correctly**. Major blocking issues resolved:
- No more SHA256 verification failures
- No more CMake "source directory does not contain CMakeLists.txt" errors  
- No more meson configuration conflicts
- No more bzip2 linker failures

### Next immediate targets

1. **Monitor gettext build completion** - currently in progress
2. **Continue through remaining dependencies**: glib, cairo, poppler, fontforge
3. **Build final pdf2htmlEX binary**
4. **Test universal binary functionality** with `lipo -info` and architecture-specific tests
5. **Update documentation** with successful build process

## 2025-07-11 ‚Äì Iteration 4

Objective: Implement the immediate targets from Iteration 2 and keep refining docs & CI.

### Actions performed in this iteration

1. **Dependency caching**
   * Added a dedicated *ccache* installation / configuration step to `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
   * Added a second `actions/cache@v3` block targeting `~/.cache/ccache` keyed by architecture and formula hash.
2. **Workflow enhancements**
   * Extended formula test step to run an additional `pdf2htmlEX --version` runtime check.
3. **Documentation & tracking**
   * Marked `Add dependency caching to speed up CI builds`, `Create v2/README.md`, and `Create v2/scripts/update-version.sh` as complete in `TODO.md`.
   * Updated `WORK.md` with current iteration details.

### Next immediate targets (queued for next iteration)

Immediate focus for next iteration (Iteration 5):

1. Add small JPEG-containing `sample.pdf` to `testdata/` and hook it into build script functional test.
2. Begin porting build logic into `v2/Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb` (Phase 2).
3. Expand README/docs to cover local builder usage & troubleshooting.

## 2025-07-11 ‚Äì Iteration 2

Objective: Continue /work cycle ‚Äì review TODO & PLAN, reflect, refine.

### Actions performed in this iteration

1. Updated `TODO.md` ‚Äì phased out completed items under Formula Creation and GitHub Actions setup.
2. Adjusted `.github/workflows/*` files to reference the **v2** formula path:
   * `test.yml` ‚Äì audit/install/test steps now point to `v2/Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb` and cache key updated.
   * `release.yml` ‚Äì release instructions and build-bottle job updated.
   * `security.yml` ‚Äì formula audit checks updated.
3. Re-created `release.yml` after an accidental overwrite.

### Next immediate targets (queued for next iteration)

1. Add explicit **dependency caching** step to the `test.yml` workflow (Homebrew downloads already cached; consider ccache for C/C++).
2. Compose `v2/README.md` detailing the v2 build strategy.
3. Enhance formula test block if `brew audit --strict` indicates missing checks.
