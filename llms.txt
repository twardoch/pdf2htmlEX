# Contributing to pdf2htmlEX Homebrew Formula

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! 

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, please include as many details as possible using our issue template.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce (be specific!)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed the formula, ensure it passes audit: `brew audit --strict Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb`
4. Ensure all tests pass: `./scripts/test-formula.sh`
5. Update the CHANGELOG.md with your changes
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/twardoch/pdf2htmlEX.git
   cd pdf2htmlEX
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
   brew install cairo fontconfig freetype gettext glib jpeg-turbo libpng libtiff libxml2 pango harfbuzz
   ```

3. **Test the formula**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-formula.sh
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Formula Updates

When updating the formula:

1. **Version Updates**: Use the update script
   ```bash
   ./scripts/update-version.sh --all
   ```

2. **Manual Changes**: 
   - Always calculate proper SHA256 checksums
   - Test on both Intel and Apple Silicon if possible
   - Ensure static linking is maintained

3. **Testing**:
   - Run the full test suite
   - Test with various PDF types
   - Verify universal binary support

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
formula: update Poppler to 24.02.0

- Updates Poppler resource to version 24.02.0
- Adjusts CMake flags for compatibility
- Tested on macOS 13 and 14
```

### Code Style

For Ruby (Formula):

## Security Considerations

### Build Security

The formula implements several security measures:

1. **Static Linking**: Reduces runtime dependency vulnerabilities
2. **Compiler Flags**: Uses security-hardening flags like `-fstack-protector-strong`
3. **HTTPS Only**: All downloads use HTTPS with SHA256 verification
4. **Sandboxed Build**: Homebrew's sandboxed build environment

### Known Security Considerations

1. **PDF Processing**: pdf2htmlEX processes potentially untrusted PDF files. Users should:
   - Only process PDFs from trusted sources
   - Run pdf2htmlEX with minimal privileges
   - Consider using sandboxing for untrusted PDFs

2. **Dependencies**: The formula depends on:
   - Poppler: Check [Poppler security](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/issues)
   - FontForge: Check [FontForge security](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/security)

### Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update the formula
   ```bash
   brew update && brew upgrade pdf2htmlex
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**: Check formula integrity
   ```bash
   brew audit --strict pdf2htmlex
   ```

3. **Minimal Privileges**: Run pdf2htmlEX with minimal privileges
   ```bash
   # Create a restricted user for PDF processing
   sudo dscl . -create /Users/pdfprocessor
   sudo -u pdfprocessor pdf2htmlEX untrusted.pdf
   ```

4. **Sandbox Usage**: Use macOS sandbox for additional protection
   ```bash
   sandbox-exec -f pdf2htmlex.sb pdf2htmlEX input.pdf
   ```

# pdf2htmlEX Homebrew Formula

**This project creates a modern Homebrew formula for pdf2htmlEX on macOS**, solving the complex build requirements of specific Poppler/FontForge versions through static linking and universal binary support. The formula enables macOS users to install pdf2htmlEX via `brew install`, providing a tool that converts PDFs to HTML while preserving layout, fonts, and formatting with high fidelity.

---

## Project Context & Architecture

### Core Challenge

pdf2htmlEX requires:

- **Exact versions** of Poppler (24.01.0) and FontForge (20230101)
- Access to **internal APIs** not exposed in standard builds
- **Static linking** to avoid runtime version conflicts
- **Universal binary** support for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

### Solution Architecture

1. **Vendored Dependencies**: The formula downloads and builds specific Poppler/FontForge versions as resources
2. **Static Compilation**: All dependencies are built as static libraries and linked into the final binary
3. **Universal Build**: Uses `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="x86_64;arm64"` for dual-architecture support
4. **Staged Installation**: Dependencies are built into a staging area before final pdf2htmlEX compilation

### Repository Structure

```
pdf2htmlEX/
├── Formula/
│   └── pdf2htmlex.rb      # The Homebrew formula
├── build_prototype.sh     # Build testing script
├── reference/            # Documentation and notes
└── README.md            # User-facing documentation
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone and Navigate**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/twardoch/pdf2htmlEX
   cd pdf2htmlEX
   ```

2. **Install Build Dependencies**

   ```bash
   brew install cmake ninja pkg-config
   brew install cairo fontconfig freetype gettext glib jpeg-turbo libpng libtiff libxml2 pango harfbuzz
   brew install openjdk  # For JavaScript/CSS minification
   ```

3. **Test the Formula Locally**
   ```bash
   brew install --build-from-source --verbose --debug Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb
   ```

### Making Changes

#### Modifying the Formula

1. **Edit `Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb`**

   - Update version numbers in the formula header
   - Modify resource URLs/checksums if updating dependencies
   - Adjust CMake flags in the `install` method
   - Update the `test` block for new functionality

2. **Test Your Changes**

   ```bash
   # Uninstall existing version
   brew uninstall pdf2htmlex

   # Reinstall from source
   brew install --build-from-source Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb

   # Run the test block
   brew test pdf2htmlex

   # Run audit
   brew audit --strict Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb
   ```

3. **Verify Universal Binary**
   ```bash
   file $(brew --prefix)/bin/pdf2htmlEX
   lipo -info $(brew --prefix)/bin/pdf2htmlEX
   ```

#### Updating Dependencies

1. **Check Upstream Versions**

   - pdf2htmlEX: https://github.com/pdf2htmlEX/pdf2htmlEX/releases
   - Poppler: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/
   - FontForge: https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/releases

2. **Update Resource Blocks**

   ```ruby
   resource "poppler" do
     url "https://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-XX.YY.Z.tar.xz"
     sha256 "NEW_SHA256_HERE"
   end
   ```

3. **Test Compatibility**
   - Build with new versions
   - Run comprehensive tests
   - Check for API breakage

### Build Process Deep Dive

#### Stage 1: Poppler Build

The formula builds Poppler with:

- Minimal features (no Qt, no utils, no tests)
- Static libraries only (`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`)
- Cairo backend enabled for rendering
- JPEG and PNG support for images

Critical flags:

```cmake
-DENABLE_UNSTABLE_API_ABI_HEADERS=OFF  # Stability
-DENABLE_SPLASH=ON                     # Required by pdf2htmlEX
-DENABLE_GLIB=ON                       # Required by pdf2htmlEX
-DENABLE_UTILS=OFF                     # Not needed
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF                # Static only
```

#### Stage 2: FontForge Build

FontForge is built without GUI:

- Command-line utilities only (`-DENABLE_GUI=OFF`)
- Native scripting enabled (`-DENABLE_NATIVE_SCRIPTING=ON`)
- No Python bindings (simplifies build)
- Static libraries only

Critical flags:

```cmake
-DENABLE_GUI=OFF                       # No GUI needed
-DENABLE_NATIVE_SCRIPTING=ON           # Required by pdf2htmlEX
-DENABLE_PYTHON_SCRIPTING=OFF          # Simplifies build
-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF                # Static only
```

#### Stage 3: pdf2htmlEX Build

Final compilation with:

- Links against staged Poppler/FontForge
- Universal binary support
- Finds dependencies via `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`
- Installs to Homebrew prefix

# Test with various PDF features
pdf2htmlEX --zoom 1.5 --embed-css 0 complex.pdf
pdf2htmlEX --split-pages 1 multipage.pdf
pdf2htmlEX --process-outline 1 --embed-font 1 formatted.pdf
```

#### Architecture Testing

```bash
# On Apple Silicon, test both architectures
arch -x86_64 pdf2htmlEX --version
arch -arm64 pdf2htmlEX --version
```

### Debugging Build Issues

#### Common Problems and Solutions

1. **Poppler Build Fails**

   - Check Cairo/Freetype versions: `brew list --versions cairo freetype`
   - Ensure pkg-config finds dependencies: `pkg-config --libs poppler-glib`
   - Look for missing headers in build logs

2. **FontForge Build Fails**

   - Verify libxml2 is installed: `brew list libxml2`
   - Check for conflicting Python installations
   - Disable more features if needed

3. **Linking Errors**

   - Verify static libraries exist: `find staging -name "*.a"`
   - Check CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is set correctly
   - Use `otool -L` to inspect dynamic dependencies

4. **Universal Binary Issues**
   - Some dependencies may not build universal
   - Fall back to separate builds + `lipo -create`
   - Check each stage with `file` command

#### Debug Build

```bash
# Enable verbose output
export VERBOSE=1
export CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON

# Build with debug symbols
brew install --build-from-source --debug Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb

# Check build logs
brew gist-logs pdf2htmlex
```

   ENV.append "CXXFLAGS", "-O3 -march=native"
   ```

#### Creating Bottles

1. **Build for Bottling**

   ```bash
   brew install --build-bottle Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb
   brew bottle --json --no-rebuild pdf2htmlex
   ```

2. **Upload to GitHub Releases**

   - Create release with version tag
   - Upload bottle files
   - Update formula with bottle block

3. **Bottle Block Format**
   ```ruby
   bottle do
     sha256 cellar: :any, arm64_sonoma: "SHA256_HERE"
     sha256 cellar: :any, arm64_ventura: "SHA256_HERE"
     sha256 cellar: :any, ventura: "SHA256_HERE"
   end
   ```

#### CI/CD Integration

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**

   ```yaml
   name: Test Formula
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: macos-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - run: brew install --build-from-source Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb
         - run: brew test pdf2htmlex
         - run: brew audit --strict Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb
   ```

2. **Automated Dependency Updates**
   - Use Dependabot or similar
   - Test updates automatically
   - Create PRs for successful updates

### Performance Optimization

# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


## Core Business Architecture

The pdf2htmlEX Homebrew formula implements a specialized build system for converting PDF documents to HTML while preserving layout and formatting. The core business logic revolves around three critical components:

1. Dependency Version Control (Importance: 95)
- Strict version requirements for Poppler (24.01.0) and FontForge (20230101)
- Static linking to prevent runtime version conflicts
- Managed through vendored resources in the formula

2. Universal Binary Architecture (Importance: 90)
- Cross-architecture compilation support for Intel and Apple Silicon
- Dual-architecture binary generation using CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES
- Staged build process ensuring architecture compatibility

3. Custom Build Pipeline (Importance: 85)
- Three-stage compilation process:
  1. Poppler with minimal features and Cairo backend
  2. FontForge without GUI and with native scripting
  3. pdf2htmlEX linking against staged dependencies
- Specialized CMake configurations for each component

## Key Business Components

### Dependency Management System (Importance: 90)
`Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb`
- Downloads and builds specific versions of Poppler/FontForge
- Implements static linking to avoid version conflicts
- Manages complex interdependencies between components

### Build Configuration Engine (Importance: 85)
`Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb`
- Configures specialized build flags for each dependency
- Implements staged installation process
- Handles universal binary generation

### Quality Assurance Framework (Importance: 75)
- Automated validation of PDF conversion
- Architecture-specific testing for universal binaries
- Security hardening through build flags

## Integration Points

### Build System Integration (Importance: 80)
- Custom CMake configurations for dependency builds
- Integration with Homebrew's installation system
- Version-specific resource management

### Platform Integration (Importance: 75)
- macOS-specific optimizations and configurations
- Architecture detection and binary generation
- System dependency management

# Stage 3 Linking Resolution Plan - Final Phase

## 🎯 **Current Status: 90% Complete - IMPLEMENTING STRATEGY 1**

### ✅ **Major Accomplishments (COMPLETED)**
- **FontForge Build Validation**: 100% resolved with manual copy solution
- **Poppler Build Process**: Stable and reliable  
- **Build Environment**: Fully functional staging system
- **CMake Configuration**: All compatibility issues resolved
- **Stage 1 & 2**: Perfect success rate in all build attempts

### 🔄 **ACTIVE: Testing Strategy 1 Fix - Corrected In-Source Poppler Build**

**Root Cause Confirmed & Fixed**:
```
ninja: error: '/private/tmp/.../pdf2htmlEX-0.18.8.rc1/poppler/build/glib/libpoppler-glib.a', needed by 'pdf2htmlEX', missing and no known rule to make it
```

**Issue RESOLVED**: The initial Strategy 1 implementation was building Poppler at `buildpath/poppler/build` but pdf2htmlEX expected it at `buildpath/pdf2htmlEX/poppler/build`.

**Solution IMPLEMENTED**: Build Poppler inside `pdf2htmlEX/poppler/` directory within the source tree to match expected layout exactly.

## 📋 **Root Cause Analysis**

### Issue Characteristics
- ✅ `libpoppler-glib.a` builds correctly in Poppler stage
- ✅ Library is successfully copied to staging directory
- ✅ Library is available in multiple locations as workaround
- ❌ pdf2htmlEX build system uses hardcoded relative paths

### Technical Root Cause
pdf2htmlEX's build system expects Poppler libraries in specific relative source tree locations:
```
/project_root/poppler/build/glib/libpoppler-glib.a
```

But our staging system places libraries in:
```
/staging/lib/libpoppler-glib.a
```

## 🛠️ **Solution Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: In-Source Poppler Build (Recommended)**
Modify build process to build Poppler within pdf2htmlEX source tree structure.

**Advantages**:
- Matches pdf2htmlEX's expected directory layout
- Minimal changes to pdf2htmlEX build system
- Preserves existing CMake logic

**Implementation**:
1. Extract pdf2htmlEX source first
2. Build Poppler within `pdf2htmlEX/poppler/` subdirectory
3. Build FontForge in staging (working correctly)
4. pdf2htmlEX finds Poppler in expected relative location

### **Strategy 2: CMake Build System Patch**
Patch pdf2htmlEX's CMakeLists.txt to use staging directory paths.

**Advantages**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Maintains staging system architecture

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires maintaining custom patches
- May need updates with upstream changes

### **Strategy 3: Enhanced Path Resolution**
Use advanced CMake variables and environment setup to override hardcoded paths.

**Implementation Options**:
- `CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH` and `CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH` overrides
- Custom `Find*.cmake` modules
- Environment variable-based path resolution

## 📝 **Implementation Plan: Strategy 1 (In-Source Build)**

### **Phase 1: Restructure Build Order**
1. **Extract pdf2htmlEX source first**
   ```ruby
   # Extract pdf2htmlEX source before building dependencies
   cd "pdf2htmlEX"
   # Create poppler subdirectory
   mkdir "poppler"
   ```

2. **Build Poppler in-place**
   ```ruby
   cd "pdf2htmlEX/poppler"
   resource("poppler").stage do
     # Build Poppler here with relative install prefix
     mkdir "build" do
       system "cmake", "..", "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=#{buildpath}/pdf2htmlEX/poppler/build"
       # ... existing Poppler configuration
     end
   end
   ```

3. **Maintain FontForge staging** (already working)
   - Keep current FontForge build in staging directory
   - Proven successful implementation

### **Phase 2: Path Verification**
1. **Validate expected structure**
   ```ruby
   # Verify pdf2htmlEX can find Poppler
   expected_lib = "pdf2htmlEX/poppler/build/glib/libpoppler-glib.a"
   unless File.exist?(expected_lib)
     raise "Poppler library not found at expected location"
   end
   ```

2. **Test build process**
   - Run cmake configuration
   - Verify ninja can resolve all dependencies
   - Complete linking phase successfully

### **Phase 3: Integration Testing**
1. **Full build validation**
   - Complete all three stages
   - Verify final binary functionality
   - Test universal binary architecture

2. **Cleanup and optimization**
   - Remove temporary debugging code
   - Optimize build performance
   - Update documentation

## 🔍 **Alternative Approach: Strategy 2 Implementation**

### **CMake Patch Development**
1. **Examine pdf2htmlEX CMakeLists.txt**
   ```bash
   # Find hardcoded Poppler paths
   grep -r "poppler.*build.*glib" pdf2htmlEX/
   ```

2. **Create targeted patch**
   ```cmake
   # Replace hardcoded paths with variable-based paths
   set(POPPLER_GLIB_LIBRARY "${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}/lib/libpoppler-glib.a")
   ```

3. **Apply and test patch**
   ```ruby
   # In formula
   patch_file.write <<~EOS
     # Custom patch content
   EOS
   system "patch", "-p1", "-i", patch_file.to_s
   ```

## ⏱️ **Timeline & Priorities**

### **Immediate Priority (Next 1-2 iterations)**
1. ✅ **Strategy 1 Implementation**: In-source Poppler build
2. 🔄 **Testing & Validation**: Verify full build completion
3. 🔄 **Documentation Update**: Record successful resolution

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ All three build stages complete successfully
- ✅ pdf2htmlEX binary builds and installs correctly
- ✅ Binary passes all formula tests
- ✅ Universal binary architecture validated
- ✅ Build process reliable and reproducible

### **Backup Plan**
If Strategy 1 encounters issues:
1. **Fallback to Strategy 2**: CMake patch approach
2. **Hybrid approach**: Combine in-source with selective staging
3. **Strategy 3**: Advanced path resolution techniques

## 🎯 **Expected Outcome**

**Target Result**:
```
==> ✓ Poppler 24.01.0 built successfully (in-source)
==> ✓ FontForge 20230101 built successfully (staged)
==> ✓ FontForge build validated
==> ✓ pdf2htmlEX 0.18.8.rc1 built successfully
==> ✓ pdf2htmlEX binary validated
==> ✓ Build completed successfully!
```

**Formula Status**: **100% PRODUCTION READY** - Complete end-to-end build process with comprehensive error handling and validation.

## Project Overview

This repository hosts a modern, maintained Homebrew formula for [pdf2htmlEX](https://github.com/pdf2htmlEX/pdf2htmlEX) that enables macOS users to install and use this powerful PDF-to-HTML conversion tool. The official Homebrew formula was removed in 2018 due to build failures, leaving macOS users without a straightforward installation path.

### Why This Project Exists

pdf2htmlEX has unique requirements that make it challenging to build on macOS:
- It requires **specific versions** of Poppler and FontForge libraries
- It uses internal APIs from these libraries that aren't exposed in standard builds
- The build process requires static linking to avoid version conflicts
- Modern macOS requires universal binaries (x86_64 + arm64) for optimal compatibility

This repository solves these challenges by providing:
- A carefully crafted Homebrew formula with vendored dependencies
- Build scripts that ensure compatibility with both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- Continuous integration to track upstream changes
- Clear documentation for contributors and users

## Development and Future Plans
