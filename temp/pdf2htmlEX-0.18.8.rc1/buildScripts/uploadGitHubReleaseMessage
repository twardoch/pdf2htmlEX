This is the most recent release of the pdf2htmlEX project.

We release three types of binary objects:

1. The file *.AppImage on this release page is an AppImage

   You can download the AppImage, make it executable and then 'just run 
   it'. 

   See: https://appimage.org/ for details

2. The file *.deb is a Debian Archive

   You can download the Debian Archive and install it locally using: 
   
       sudo apt install <<releativePathToDebFile>>

   While the Debian archive is built on a specific Ubuntu release, it can 
   usually be used on any more recent Ubuntu releases. 

3. You can alternatively get pdf2htmlEX Container images from Docker Hub in 
   either of the repositories: 

       pdf2htmlEX/pdf2htmlEX (offical release)

   or 

       stephengaito/pdf2htmlEX (development releases)

We also release a zip archive of the browser test results in the 
*-testResults.zip file. 

Finally, the various *.txt and *buildInfo.sh files have well known 
(unchanging) names which can be used by automatic scripts to identifiy the 
current full names of the corresponding binary artifacts.
