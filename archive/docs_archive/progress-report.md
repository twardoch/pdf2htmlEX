- Verified all dependency checksums

### Phase 3.1: CI/CD Workflows ✓
- Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows
- Implemented multi-platform testing
- Added security scanning
- Set up automated release process

### Phase 4: Development Infrastructure (90% Complete)

- Added Makefile for common tasks
- Created .editorconfig for code consistency
- Only missing: benchmark.sh script

## Partially Completed Phases

### Phase 2.2: Build Process Enhancements
- **Status**: Design complete, implementation pending
- Created `patches/formula-enhancements.patch` with:
  - Error handling improvements
  - Progress indicators
  - Build validation
  - Caching support
  - Rollback mechanism
- **Next Step**: Apply patches to actual formula

### Phase 5: Testing Suite
- Basic test infrastructure created
- Integration tests implemented
- Test fixtures directory set up
- **Missing**: Comprehensive PDF test files, unit tests

### Phase 6: Documentation
- CONTRIBUTING.md ✓
- CHANGELOG.md ✓
- SECURITY.md ✓
- README.md updates ✓
- **Missing**: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, troubleshooting guide, badges

### Phase 9: Community Features
