This document summarizes the refactoring and improvements made to the pdf2htmlEX Homebrew formula project.

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. Repository Structure Reorganization
- Created proper directory hierarchy following Homebrew and best practices
- Moved formula from root to `Formula/` directory
- Organized scripts, tests, documentation, and CI/CD configurations

### 2. CI/CD Implementation
Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows:
- **test.yml**: Multi-platform testing across macOS 12, 13, and 14
- **release.yml**: Automated release process with bottle building
- **security.yml**: Weekly security scans and vulnerability checking

### 3. Development Infrastructure
Created essential development scripts:
- **test-formula.sh**: Comprehensive local testing with architecture validation
- **update-version.sh**: Automated version updates with SHA256 calculation
- **check-dependencies.sh**: System compatibility and dependency verification

### 4. Testing Framework
- Set up test directory structure with fixtures and integration tests
- Created test PDF generation scripts
- Implemented conversion testing with various options

### 5. Documentation Enhancement
- Created TODO.md with detailed implementation roadmap
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
- Created comprehensive CHANGELOG.md
- Added issue and PR templates for better community engagement

### 6. Build System Improvements
- Fixed placeholder SHA256 checksums in the formula
- Created Makefile for common development tasks
- Updated .gitignore for project-specific patterns

## Key Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipelines
- `scripts/` - Development helper scripts
- `tests/` - Test infrastructure
- `TODO.md` - Detailed project roadmap
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `Makefile` - Development automation

### Modified Files

- `.gitignore` - Added project-specific patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Test the formula installation locally
   - Verify CI/CD workflows function correctly
   - Create initial GitHub release

2. **Short-term Goals**
   - Expand test coverage with more PDF types
   - Implement bottle building automation
   - Add performance benchmarking

3. **Long-term Vision**
   - Create official Homebrew tap
   - Implement automated dependency updates
   - Build community around the project

## Testing the Changes

To verify the refactoring:

```bash
# Check dependencies
make check-deps

# Install and test formula
make install
make test

# Run full CI suite locally
make ci
```

## Impact

These changes transform the project from a single formula file into a well-structured, maintainable project with:
- Automated testing and releases
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Security monitoring
- Professional development workflow

The foundation is now in place for sustainable community-driven development.
