```
./v2/scripts/build.sh > ./build_logs/v2_stdout.txt 2> ./build_logs/v2_stderr.txt
```

Check the output files. 

Into @PLAN.md write a detailed proposal to make pdf2htmlEX build and run on macOS. This is our definitive goal. 

Then /work on items from @PLAN.md and @TODO.md , then review reflect refine revise, and then continue to /work on @PLAN.md and @TODO.md until every single item and issue has been fixed. Iterate iterate iterate! Do not stop, do not ask for confirmation. Work! When you're finishing one task or item, say "Wait, but..." and go on to the next task/item.
