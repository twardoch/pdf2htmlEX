run `./build.sh` and then check the `./build_logs`. If needed   
read the  ./llms.txt code snapshot. Then /work on items from      
 ./TODO.md consulting on  ./PLAN.md. Then review reflect refine     
revise, and then continue to /work on  ./PLAN.md and  ./TODO.md     
until every single item and issue has been fixed. Iterate       
iterate iterate! Do not stop, do not ask for confirmation.      
Work! When you're finishing one task or item, say "Wait,        
but..." and go on to the next task/item. Itâ€™s CRUCIAL that we   
get to a solution that BUILDS everything correctly!
