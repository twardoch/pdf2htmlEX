# v2 attempt to make pdf2htmlEX work on macOS

- `v1/` contains an extensive v1 attempt to make pdf2htmlEX work on macOS. Ultimately this was unsuccessful. 
- `v2/` is there we need to start a new: 
    - Read `ORIG_BUILDING.md` 
    - Analyze `v1/` or the full codebase snapshot in `llms.txt` 
    - Into `PLAN.md` write detailed extensive insights, and a strong strategic plan on how to overcome the failure. We need a systemmatic future-proof solid approach.
