# Comprehensive Plan for Resolving FontForge Build Validation Failure

## Problem Analysis

### Issue Summary (from issues/104.txt)
The pdf2htmlEX build process is failing at the FontForge validation stage with:
```
==> ‚úì FontForge 20230101 built successfully (20.1s)
Error: Build validation failed: FontForge artifact not found at /private/tmp/pdf2htmlex-20250629-50345-jd868d/pdf2htmlEX-0.18.8.rc1/staging/lib/libfontforge.a
Error: Build failed: FontForge build validation failed
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**Key Finding**: FontForge builds successfully but the static library is not installed to the staging directory.

After analyzing the FontForge codebase in `archive/fontforge/`, I discovered the root cause in `fontforge/CMakeLists.txt` lines 282-289:

```cmake
# No dev package -> no need to install if static
if(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
  if(WIN32 OR CYGWIN)
    install(TARGETS fontforge RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR} LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR})
  else()
    install(TARGETS fontforge RUNTIME DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR} LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR})
  endif()
endif()
```

**The Problem**: When our formula sets `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`, FontForge:
1. ‚úÖ Builds the static library correctly (`libfontforge.a`)
2. ‚ùå Does NOT install it due to the conditional install block
3. ‚ùå Validation fails because `staging/lib/libfontforge.a` doesn't exist

### Build Process Flow Analysis

1. **Stage 1: Poppler** - ‚úÖ Works correctly
2. **Stage 2: FontForge** - ‚ö†Ô∏è  Builds but doesn't install static library
3. **Stage 3: pdf2htmlEX** - ‚ùå Never reached due to validation failure

## Solution Strategy

### Approach 1: Manual Library Copy (Recommended)
Add a step after FontForge's `ninja install` to manually copy the built static library to the staging directory.

**Advantages**:
- Minimal change to existing formula
- No modifications to FontForge's build system
- Clear and straightforward implementation

### Approach 2: Force FontForge Installation (Alternative)
Patch FontForge's CMakeLists.txt to always install the library regardless of `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`.

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex patching
- Requires maintaining additional patches

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Modify Formula to Copy Static Library
In `Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb`, after the FontForge `ninja install` command, add:

```ruby
# Stage 2: Build FontForge
build_with_progress("FontForge 20230101") do
  resource("fontforge").stage do
    mkdir "build" do
      # ... existing cmake and ninja install commands ...
      system "ninja", "install"
      
      # Manual copy of static library since FontForge doesn't install it when BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
      lib_source = "lib/libfontforge.a"
      lib_dest = "#{staging_prefix}/lib/libfontforge.a"
      
      if File.exist?(lib_source)
        system "mkdir", "-p", "#{staging_prefix}/lib"
        system "cp", lib_source, lib_dest
        ohai "‚úì Manually copied libfontforge.a to staging directory"
      else
        onoe "Static library not found at #{lib_source}"
        raise "FontForge static library build failed"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Step 2: Validate the Fix
The existing validation should now pass:
```ruby
validate_build_stage("FontForge", staging_prefix/"lib/libfontforge.a")
```

### Step 3: Test Build Process
1. Run `./build.sh` or `brew install --build-from-source Formula/pdf2htmlex.rb`
2. Verify FontForge stage completes successfully
3. Verify pdf2htmlEX stage begins and completes
4. Validate final binary functionality

## Expected Outcomes

### Build Log Changes
- FontForge build should show: `‚úì Manually copied libfontforge.a to staging directory`
- FontForge validation should show: `‚úì FontForge build validated`
- pdf2htmlEX stage should begin successfully

### Success Criteria
1. ‚úÖ FontForge builds and library is copied to staging
2. ‚úÖ FontForge validation passes
3. ‚úÖ pdf2htmlEX builds successfully
4. ‚úÖ Final binary works correctly
5. ‚úÖ All tests pass

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- The manual copy approach is straightforward and safe
- Existing build stages (Poppler) are unaffected
- Change is isolated to FontForge build stage

### Contingency Plans
If manual copy approach fails:
1. **Debug**: Check exact build directory structure
2. **Alternative**: Use `find` command to locate the built library
3. **Fallback**: Implement Approach 2 (patch FontForge CMakeLists.txt)

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate**: Implement the manual copy solution
2. **Validate**: Test build process end-to-end
3. **Document**: Update any relevant documentation
4. **Close**: Mark issue 104.txt as resolved

## Additional Observations

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier
- Previous issues (102.txt, 103.txt) were focused on patch application problems
- The build was failing earlier in the process, masking this validation issue
- Issue 104.txt shows the build progressed further, revealing the new problem

### Formula Improvements
This analysis suggests the formula could benefit from:
1. More detailed logging during each build stage
2. Better error messages for build validation failures
3. Cleaner separation between build and validation steps

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Read issues/104.txt** - Completed
2. ‚úÖ **Consult archive/fontforge/** - Completed, found root cause
3. ‚úÖ **Analyze llms.txt** - Reviewed existing code structure
4. ‚úÖ **Write comprehensive plan** - This document
5. üîÑ **Implement the plan** - Next action
6. üîÑ **Run ./build.sh and analyze** - Next action
7. üîÑ **Iterate until solved** - Next action
