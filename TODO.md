# TODO: pdf2htmlEX Homebrew Formula Implementation

## Current Phase: Complete Vendored Formula Implementation

### Immediate Tasks (Current Priority)
- [x] Replace template formula with complete vendored implementation
- [x] Update formula to use Poppler 24.01.0 (updated from 22.12.0)
- [x] Simplify formula structure by removing excessive header stubbing
- [ ] Test build with proper vendored dependencies
- [ ] Validate universal binary output for both Intel and Apple Silicon
- [ ] Run comprehensive validation tests

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Formula builds without errors using vendored Poppler 24.01.0 and FontForge 20230101
- [ ] Binary converts PDF to HTML correctly  
- [ ] Universal binary supports both Intel and Apple Silicon
- [ ] Passes `brew audit` and `brew test`

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Identified exact versions and approach needed
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test suite with validation scripts
- ‚úÖ Confirmed CMakeLists.txt patching works
- ‚úÖ Verified version incompatibility issue (Poppler 25.06.0 vs 24.01.0)
- ‚úÖ Implemented clean vendored formula with Poppler 24.01.0 and FontForge 20230101
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**: Testing and validation of the implementation
- ‚è≥ **NEXT**: Production testing and optimization

### Risk Mitigation (If Needed)
- [ ] If Poppler 24.01.0 fails on macOS, try Poppler 23.x series
- [ ] If FontForge linking fails, use dynamic libraries (.dylib) instead of static (.a)
- [ ] Apply additional patches from official formula if needed

## Next Phase Tasks
- [ ] Run full build test on clean macOS environment
- [ ] Test with real-world PDF files of various complexity
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Create bottle builds for distribution
- [ ] Documentation and release preparation
