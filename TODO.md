# TODO.md

## Phase 1: Complete Builds (🎯 **URGENT - FOCUS HERE**)
- [x] ✅ **Critical build fixes** - SHA256, extraction, config issues (COMPLETED)
- [x] ✅ **Core dependencies built** - libjpeg-turbo, libpng, libgif, bzip2, brotli, expat, harfbuzz (COMPLETED)
- [ ] ⏳ **gettext** - Currently building, monitor completion
- [ ] 🎯 **glib** - Next critical dependency
- [ ] 🎯 **cairo** - Required for poppler
- [ ] 🎯 **lcms2** - Color management
- [ ] 🎯 **freetype** - Font rendering
- [ ] 🎯 **fontconfig** - Font configuration
- [ ] 🎯 **Poppler** - PDF processing library
- [ ] 🎯 **FontForge** - Font manipulation
- [ ] 🎯 **pdf2htmlEX** - THE FINAL GOAL
- [ ] ✅ **Verify working binary** - Test successful build

## Phase 2: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test pdf2htmlEX binary on x86_64 architecture
- [ ] Test pdf2htmlEX binary on arm64 architecture
- [ ] Test PDF conversion with sample files
- [ ] Verify universal binary support with `lipo -info`
- [ ] Add automated build verification tests to v2 system

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance
- [ ] Create sample PDF test suite for validation
- [ ] Add test PDFs with various features (images, fonts, forms)
- [ ] Benchmark conversion speed on both architectures
- [ ] Test memory usage during conversion
- [ ] Verify graceful error handling with malformed PDFs
- [ ] Track build time for v2 approach
- [ ] Measure and document final binary size

## Phase 4: Documentation and Distribution
- [ ] Document v2 build process and requirements
- [ ] Create usage instructions for pdf2htmlEX
- [ ] Create distributable package from v2 build
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for automated builds
- [ ] Establish version management and release process

## Technical Improvements (📋 **LOWER PRIORITY - AFTER SUCCESSFUL BUILD**)
- [x] ✅ **Critical error handling** - Fixed blocking build failures (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Enhanced error handling in build scripts
- [ ] Detailed logging improvements  
- [ ] Build status indicators
- [ ] Progress reporting for long builds
- [ ] Build artifact caching
- [ ] Build dependency verification
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for common issues

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**
1. **Monitor gettext build** - Currently in progress, should complete soon
2. **Watch for any new build failures** - Address immediately when they appear
3. **Maintain build momentum** - System is now functional, keep it moving
4. **Focus on pdf2htmlEX binary** - Ultimate success metric
5. **Test immediately after build** - Verify functionality on both architectures
