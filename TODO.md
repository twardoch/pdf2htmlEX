## Completed Build Fixes âœ…

### v1 Build Issues - FIXED
- [x] Fix Poppler API compatibility issues in font.cc:
  - `FoFiTrueType::load()` returns `std::unique_ptr<FoFiTrueType>` not raw pointer
  - `font->getName()` returns `std::string` not `GooString*` (no `toStr()` method)
  - `font->locateFont()` returns `std::optional<GfxFontLoc>` not `GfxFontLoc*`
  - `GfxFontLoc::path` is `std::string` not `GooString*`
- [x] Add comprehensive patches to v1 Homebrew formula for all affected files

### v2 Build Issues - FIXED
- [x] Fix libtiff linking errors:
  - Missing libdeflate symbols for arm64 architecture
  - Missing WebP symbols for arm64 architecture
  - Need to ensure all dependencies are built as universal binaries
- [x] Reorder dependency builds to ensure proper sequencing
- [x] Convert libtiff to per-architecture builds with lipo merging
- [x] Add proper library path specifications for all dependencies

## Current Testing Phase

### Immediate Next Steps
- [ ] Test v1 build (Homebrew formula) - verify successful compilation
- [ ] Test v2 build (standalone script) - verify universal binary creation
- [ ] Functional testing - test PDF conversion with sample files
- [ ] Architecture verification - confirm arm64 and x86_64 support

### Build System Improvements
- [ ] Add build verification tests to both v1 and v2 systems
- [ ] Create sample PDF test suite for validation
- [ ] Add build time and binary size tracking
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging

## Original Plan - Updated Status

- [x] Create a `vendor` directory.
- [x] Update the build script (`v2/scripts/build.sh`) to download and build all dependencies.
- [x] Fix all major build issues and linking errors
- [x] Update `pdf2htmlEX` CMakeLists.txt to link against vendored dependencies.
- [x] Build `pdf2htmlEX` as a static, universal binary.
- [ ] Test the `pdf2htmlEX` binary on both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.
- [ ] Refine and document the build process.
