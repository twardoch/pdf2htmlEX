CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:98 (message):
  

   No test data found in $testdatadir.
   You will not be able to run 'make test' successfully.

  

   The test data is not included in the source packages
   and is also not part of the main git repository. Instead,
   you can checkout the test data from its own git
   repository with:

  

     git clone git://git.freedesktop.org/git/poppler/test

  

   You should checkout the test data as a sibling of your
   poppler source folder or specify the location of your
   checkout with -DTESTDATADIR=/path/to/checkoutdir/test.
